# gpt-3.5-turbo-DPT-Jailbreaker
Jailbreaker for ChatGPT 3.5-turbo


If you're here, you most likely already know what ChatGPT is, so I'm not going to bother to explain it. This Jailbreak is inspired by https://github.com/GabryB03 's jailbreak, so credit to them.

First of all, lets go over a quick summary of what a jailbreak is.
A jailbreak is a proccess of taking restrictions away, like if someone was to jailbreak a Roku, they'd be able to watch whatever they want with no restrictions. In this case, we're removing the restrictions on ChatGpt-3.5-Turbo, making it unhinged.

This jailbreak will not only remove the restrictions on GPT but will make it polliticaly incorrect and completley crazy. My version makes it so that it will only have one response (the one in DPT mode), and not state that it is in DPT mode. Also my version gives it a more casual voice, trust me it is funnier that way. If the AI ever acts formal and non-casual, simply instruct it to be in a casual voice.
